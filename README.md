## In a nutshell

- The app was built with create-react-app, TypeScript, material-ui, ESLint, Jest, and testing-library/react.
- It stores favorited repos and languages in localStorage.
- No "atomic" components have been created in order to save time, but I tried to use a reasonably modular approach.
- A very simple integration test suite has been added for the App component.
- The design is somewhat fluid, but I tried to focus more on feature completeness than device compatibility.
